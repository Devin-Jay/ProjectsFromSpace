								<h1>About Me</h1>
								<p>
									Hello! I'm Devin, a senior at Northern Arizona University majoring in Computer Science. I'm passionate about becoming a full-time software engineer and have been building my skills through a variety of projects.
									<br></br.><br></br.>
									The "games" above represent work I've done over the years — some are programming projects, others are actual games. Right now, I'm developing a video game in Unity, exploring gameplay programming, art design, and even creative writing.
									<br></br.><br></br.>
									I'm always looking for ways to grow as a developer and bring creative ideas to life through code.

								<p>
									I had the pleasure of participating in the Arizona Game Jam 2025 alongside 4 other students as representatives of Northern Arizona University &mdash; and we won. Our team had 24 hours to create a game based on the theme "Creepy," and we thought, "What's the creepiest thing we can think of &mdash; men!" So, we created Ex-traterrestrial! Play as a man trying to save his girlfriend. Explore her apartment while avoiding the alien in a desperate attempt to save the love of your life. As you play, you'll find that everything is not as it seems, and maybe, there are creepier things than giant green aliens!
									<br>
									<br>
									My primary responsibility was developing the AI for the alien that stalks you around the house, making sure it chases you if it sees you or hears you, and patrols the house when it doesn't. I also assisted in the integration of our many features, making sure everything worked as we all intended.
									<br>
									<br>
									This was an incredible experience: I met so many new people who also shared my love for game development, and I learned a lot about working in a team under a tight deadline. Play Ex-traterrestrial now, and discover the true meaning of creepy!

								<p>
									Dying For You is a 2-D side-scrolling platformer submitted to the Jamsepticeye Game Jam 2025 in which I had 5 days to create a polished game. The theme of the jam was "Death is an Opportunity!" Play as a depressed stick figure who, after losing their partner, has nothing to live for. When they try to kill themselves, they find that they cannot die! You must use your new found abilities to save the lives of others, which inspired the title &mdash; Dying For You. I had a lot of fun working on this game, spending most of the time hand drawing the characters and backgrounds and also animating everything using Toonsquid. I also programmed the entirety of the game mechanics in Unity. Balancing developing this game as well as class work was tough, but I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in such a short time frame. Play Dying For You now! And remember &mdash; sometimes to save yourself, you have to save others.

									VicM is a 2-D dungeon crawler where you play as, you guessed it &mdash; VicM, the tofu boy. You must enter into the dungeon to fight off the SoggyFry and the BurgerBoss, the king of the junk foods. I had the pleasure of working with 5 other people to bring VicM to life for a video game design class. I was responsible for creating several game mechanics, including the chopstick and soy sauce attacks. I also programmed and animated all of the enemies and VicM himself, making sure each attack (from both player and enemy) felt fun and impactful.

								<p>
									Bubble Buzzer Beater was created for the annual Global Game Jam 2025. Three other game designers and I spent 48 hours creating a game that had to do with the year's topic of bubbles. The game consists of many mini games that the player has to complete. I spent my time creating a bubble blowing mini game in which the player has to "blow" into their mic to create a bubble. I also made a jump scare minigame that takes your picture when it scares you and displays that picture at the end of the game. It was fun to (quickly) learn how to implement both microphone and camera features. My team and I ran into many complications during the 48 hours, but we worked together to make sure everyone was able to do what they set out to do.

								<p>
									Chomp Champs is a turn-based mobile game developed for the CHI 2025 Student Game Design Competition. Its goal is to promote healthy eating habits among children by allowing them to take pictures of the foods they eat. The game then transforms the nutritional information into combat stats. Players battle their foods in-game to earn rewards; Healthier foods provide better rewards, encouraging smarter food choices. In a team of 4, I was responsible for incorporating the camera mechanics, letting players take a picture of a food that is then processed into an enemy.

									RNT-A-ROOM is an Airbnb-like website that caters towards travel nurses. In a team of 4, we worked to create a way for travel nurses to book housing for their specific needs. My role was to work on the backend of the website: using PHP to create a login system for both travel nurses and homeowners, using classes to manage the different user types and housing options, and managing the JawsDB database to make sure data is stored efficiently and that houses can actually be booked. I also worked on the frontend side whenever help was needed. It was fun to learn backend web development in such a short time span and to also work in a team in a software engineering environment.

								<p>
									Kingdom of Influence is a role-playing game designed to support adults with autism who face challenges in social situations. Players create and customize their own character, explore a vibrant town, and engage in interactive scenarios that teach them how to recognize and interpret facial expressions and social cues. The goal is to help players develop practical social skills they can apply in real-life interactions.
									The images above showcase the demo we created using Godot. Our next step is to develop the full game in Unreal Engine 4.
									My contributions so far include building the quest system, which allows players to interact with NPCs and the environment. I also animated several animals in Blender, adding life and personality to the game world.

								<h1>Operating System Simulation</h1>
								<p>
									The Github link is available upon request. <br><br>
									I created a program that simulates the operations of a Unix-like OS kernel. I utilized several data structures, such as queues and linked lists, to implement features such as process scheduling, memory management, and inter-process communication. Additionally, I used POSIX threads to simulate process execution concurrency. This project was done in four stages, which required excellent planning skills to make sure each step was ready for the next set of features.
